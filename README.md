</p>

## Features

* Zero-extra configuration. Clone it, install it, run it.
  * Easy migration from an unmanaged configuration.
  * Alternatively, Docker All-in-one: WireGuard + Web UI.
* Easy installation, simple to use.
* List, create, edit, delete clients.
* Connection statistics for connected clients.
* Configurable private key retention.
* Read-only mode.
* Simple manual configuration when editing `wg0.conf` directly.

## Requirements

* A host with a kernel that supports WireGuard (all modern kernels).
* A host with Docker installed.

## TL;DR
See [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/jasoryeh/wg-zero/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) for a full ready-to-use setup, or use the `docker run` command if you'd only like to test wg-zero out!

## Installation
There are three ways to run WireGuard zero, for new installations we recommend [`The Docker Way`](#the-docker-way) to keep your system simple, 
for existing installations, we recommend the [`The Host Way`](#the-host-way)

### The Docker Way

#### 1. Install Docker

If you haven't installed Docker yet, install it by running (this is the quick-and-dirty way, please see documentation for your specific OS for the proper way to install it):

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
$ exit
```

And log in again.

#### 2. Run WireGuard Zero

To automatically install & run wg-zero, simply run:

<pre>
$ docker run \
    --name=wg-zero \
    -p 51820:51820/udp \
    -e WG_PORT=51820 \
    -p 51821:51821/tcp \
    -e PORT=51821 \
    -v $PWD/mount/wireguard:/etc/wireguard \
    -e WG_HOST=$(curl checkip.amazonaws.com) \
    -e PASSWORD="your_secure_password_here!!" \
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    --cap-add=SYS_MODULE \
    --sysctl=net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
    --sysctl=net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 \
    --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    jasoryeh/wg-zero
</pre>

> ðŸ’¡ If your want to manually specify the server's public IP Address, replace `$(curl checkip.amazonaws.com) with a public facing IP address, a public domain pointing to the server, or a Dynamic Domain pointed at this server.
>
> ðŸ’¡  Replace `your_secure_password_here!!` with a different password!
>
> Looking for a bit more? A `docker-compose.yml` file is available in this repository that provides a full working setup with wg-zero and PiHole!

The Web UI will now be available on `http://0.0.0.0:51821`.

### The Host Way

#### 1. Clone It
Clone this repo!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasoryeh/wg-zero.git && cd wg-zero
```

#### 2. Install It
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Run It
```bash
bash ./start.sh
```

To configure additional options below, prefix the command above with your option in `KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2` form, e.g.
```
WG_READONLY=true WG_PASSWORD=password123 WG_HOST=wireguard.yourdomain.example.com bash ./start.sh
```

### More Information
That's it! See below or `server/config.js` for configurable options you can use to run WireGuard Zero.

## Options

These options can be configured by setting environment variables using `-e KEY="VALUE"` in the `docker run` command.

| Env | Default | Example | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `PASSWORD` | - | `foobar123` | When set, requires a password when logging in to the Web UI. |
| `WG_HOST` | - | `vpn.myserver.com` | The public hostname of your VPN server. |
| `WG_PORT` | `51820` | `12345` | The UDP port the actual Wireguard VPN server will listen to. |
| `PORT` | `51821` | `12345` | The port on which the Wireguard GUI will listen to. |
| `WG_INTERFACE` | `wg0` | `wg0` | Manually specify the interface name for the Wireguard server. |
| `WG_INTERNET_INTERFACE` | `eth0` | `eth0` | Manually specify the network interface that this application will attempt to configure for use with the Wireguard VPN server. This may be needed if you use a different network mode that just forwarding the port, such as `host`. |
| `WG_ADDRESS_SPACE` | `10.1.3.1/24` | `10.1.1.1/24` | Specify the address space that clients should use. |
| `WG_PRE_UP` | `...` | - | See [config.js](https://github.com/jasoryeh/wg-zero/blob/master/server/config.js#L19) for the default value. |
| `WG_POST_UP` | `...` | `iptables ...` | See [config.js](https://github.com/jasoryeh/wg-zero/blob/master/server/config.js#L20) for the default value. |
| `WG_PRE_DOWN` | `...` | - | See [config.js](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-zero/blob/master/server/config.js#L27) for the default value. |
| `WG_POST_DOWN` | `...` | `iptables ...` | See [config.js](https://github.com/jasoryeh/wg-zero/blob/master/server/config.js#L28) for the default value. |

Defaults:

| Env | Default | Example | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `WG_DEFAULT_MTU` | `null` | `1420` | The default MTU the clients will use. |
| `WG_DEFAULT_PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE` | `0` | `25` | The default keep-alive value for clients.Value in seconds to keep the "connection" open. If this value is 0, then connections won't be kept alive. |
| `WG_DEFAULT_DNS` | `1.1.1.1` | `8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4` | The default DNS server clients will use. |
| `WG_DEFAULT_ALLOWED_IPS` | `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0` | `192.168.15.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24` | The default Allowed IPs clients will use. |

> If you change `WG_PORT`, make sure to also change the exposed port.

## Updating

To update to the latest version on Docker, simply run:
```bash
docker stop wg-zero
docker rm wg-zero
docker pull jasoryeh/wg-zero
```
And then run the `docker run -d \ ...` command above again.

To update to the latest version without Docker:
```bash
git pull 
```
Then run your `start.sh` script again!


## Contributor Brief
This section is intended as a briefing for contributors looking to contribute to this repository at `jasoryeh/wg-zero`.

### Notes
This is a primarily Javascript application. The goal of this project is to provide the easiest UI to add to a WireGuard server and minimize configuration.

### Structure
This repository contains two components of wg-zero, a web component and a server component. 
There are no additional configuration files, any additional information is also stored inside of the WireGuard configuration file as a comment.

To summarize briefly:
* The **server* component interacts with the WireGuard server and configuration
  * Exposes an `expressjs` application
  * Handles parsing of configuration and actions performed on the server
* The **web** component is the user interface only, and outside servers can be used via `?endpoint=https://wg.example.com`
  * A `vite` web application at its core
* The **configuration** is solely read from `wg0.conf`
  * Additional information is stored prefixed with a `#!` in the format `Key = Value` format inside of the `.conf` file.
    * e.g. The name of peers are stored inside the `.conf` as `#!Name = Profile Name` under each peer
  * Disabled properties are prefixed with a `#$` but still read but marked not enabled

### Development
The recommended environment for developing for this repository is to develop with the server running in Docker, and `vite` watching on the `web` directory on the host.

#### Vite & WireGuard in Docker
1. In one terminal instance: `./enter_dev.sh bash` then run `cd server && npm i && npx nodemon`
2. In another instance: `cd web && npm i && npx vite`

### Full Container 
To spin up a container with both the GUI and Wireguard VPN server running, and
  additionally, have `nodemon` and `vite` running:
```
./enter_dev.sh ./dev.sh
```

### Contributions
Welcome! This fork of `wg-easy` aims to be much more flexible, feature-rich, configurable than the original repository whilst retaining it's "easy" title. All contributions are welcome!

### Fork Goals:
- Minimize external non-WireGuard configuration (maintain one configuration file as much as possible: `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`)
